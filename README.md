Implementing Continuous Integration

## Create and clone Github Repository
- To get started, a github account is needed, and it can be created by visiting the [Github Website](http://github.com/join).
- Then install git on your local machine. Visit [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Login to your git account
- To create a new repository, click on the `+` icon at the the top right corner of the page, and select `New Repository`.
    ![](./img/create_repo.png)
- Supply the necessary information about the repository on the creation page. An example is shown below.
    ![](./img/repo_info.png)
- Click ont the `Create Repository`.
- On the next page, click on `Code` to see the repository url

    ![](./img/repo.png)

- Copy the url

    ![](./img/cop_url.png)

- Go to your terminal and clone the repository by running command 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jesmanto/github-actions.git
    ```

## Installing up a Node Application
- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) with the on the website.
- Verify installation by running commands `node -v` and `npm -v` on your terminal.

## Setting up Node.js Application
- Open your VS code terminal
- On the terminal run `npm init` to initialize a node project.
- The package manage prompts you to define the name, version, description and other information about the project.

    ![](./img/npm_init.png)

- This process will generate `package.json` file in the project root directory.

## Creating Node.js Application
- Create an index.js using `touch index.js` on the terminal
- Copy the code snippet below in to index.js file.

    ```
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });

    ```


## Writing Unit Tests
- Create a test file by running `touch actions.test.js` command
- Add a Jest JUnit test for the sample app in the test file

    ```
    const request = require('supertest');
    const app = require('../index');

    describe('API Tests', () => {
        it('responds with "Hello World!"', (done) => {
            request(app).get('/').expect('Hello World!', done);
        });
    });
    ```
- Set up Jest by running `npm install --save-dev jest supertest` command.

## Create Github Environments
To manage dependencies across different environments, follow these steps
- Go to Github Repo
- Navigate to `Settings` tab
- Click on `Environments` on the left hand side
- Click on `New Environment`

    ![](/img/create_env.png)
- Provide the name of the environments and add environment secrets and variables.
- Each environment can have secrets, protection rules, and approval workflows.

    ![](/img/env_var.png)
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 to create for environments `dev` `staging` and `prod`

## Writing Github Actions Workflow to Build and Test the Application
- Create a new directory called `.github`
    ```
    mkdir .github
    ```
- Create another directory called `workflows` as a sub-directory to .github, to achieve a `.github/workflows` file structure.
    ```
    cd .github
    mkdir workflows
    ```
- Create a file named `actions.yml` which will contain the workfow.
    ```
    cd workflows
    touch actions.yml
    ```
### Creating a Parallel & Matrix Workflow
- Give a name to the workflow
    ```
    name: Build, Test and Deploy Node App CI
    ```
- Specify the event to trigger the workflow. The snippet below shows that the workflow will trigger at a push event to the main branch. This is using the `on` term.
    ```
    on:
        push:
            branches: [main]
    ```

- Define the jobs that the workflow will execute. This part defines the workflow from code integration to code testing
    ```
    jobs:
        build:

            runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        strategy:
            matrix:
                node-version: [14, 16, 18]

        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
              uses: actions/setup-node@v4
              with:
                node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

            - name: Install dependencies
              run: npm install --save-dev jest supertest express

            - name: Build Application
              run: npm run build --if-present

            - name: Test
              run: npm test

### Explanation
1. `name`: This simply names your workflow. It's wht appears on Github when the workflow is running.
2. `on`: This section defines when the workflow is triggered. Here, it's set to activate on push and pull request events to the main branch.
3. `jobs`: Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. In example, there's one job named `build`.
4. `runs-on`: Defines the type of machine to run the job on. Here, it's using the latest Ubuntu virtual machine.
5. `strategy.matrix`: This allows you to run the job on multiple versions of Nodejs, ensuring compatibility.
6. `steps`: A sequence of tasks executed as part of the job 

### Implementing parallel and matrix builds
I ran the workflow using three different versions of node versions using matrix strategy, and the jobs were successful.

### Implementing Dependencies Caching Mechanism
In order to prevent repeated downloads which will slow down the build peocess, a caching mechanism need to be put in place.

To add caching mechanism to the workflow,
- Add an action and name it `Cache node.js modules`
- Use: actions/v4
    ```
    - name: Cache Node Modules
    uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{" runner.os "}}-node-${{" hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') "}}
        restore-keys: |
        ${{" runner.os "}}-node-

    ```

### Integrating Code Quality Checks
In order to ensure our code meets standard quality, we need to put in place a code analysis tool. To do this, I added ESLint to the project. The procedures are as follows:

- Install eslint in the project root by running
    ```
    npm install --save-dev eslint
    ```
- Initialize ESLint config
    ```
    npx eslint --init
    ```
    - This steps comes with some configuration questions
        ![](./img/eslint.png)
    - When done with the questions, it creates a file named `eslint.config.mjs`
- Open the `package.json` file and add a script
    ```
    "scripts": {
        "lint": "eslint ."
    }
    ```
    - You can narrow the lint scope like "eslint src/ --ext .js" if needed.
- Open `actions.yml` file, with contains the workflow
- Add another step after installing the dependencies
    ```
    - name: Run ESLint
      run: npm run lint
    ```

## Challenges Faced
I faced so many challenges that caused my workflows to fail, these challenges include:
- ESLint not able to recognize my test files and variables.
    ![](./img/lint-test.png)
- I used a deprecated action/cache@v2
    ![](./img/deprecated_action.png)
- Problem logging in to my docker hub account 
    ![](./img/docker_error.png)

## How I solved the challenges
- For ESLint not recognizing jest commands, I edited the eslint.config file and added a new rule to accommodate test files.
    ```
    { 
        files: ["**/*.test.js","**/__tests__/*.js"], 
        languageOptions: { globals: globals.jest } 
    },
    ```
- For deprecated `action/cache@v2`, I check github actions market place for the action and got the latest version `action/cache@v4`
- For docker hub logging problem, I consulted google and chatgpt, and I discover that I was using the `--password` flag instead of `--password-stdin`. It worked after changing it from
    ```
    run: echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" -p "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" --password-stdin
    ```
    to

    ```
    run: echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
    ```

## Best Practices
- Keep your actions minimal
- Never hardcode secrets
- Do not install dependencies unnecessarily. This can be done with `Github Caching Mechanism`
- Ensure every repository contains a CI/CD workflow
- Limit the use of environment variables
- Run tests on staging and development environments only, deploy on production environment.
